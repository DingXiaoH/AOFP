# Approximated Oracle Filter Pruning for Destructive CNN Width Optimization

UPDATE: pytorch implementation released. But I am not sure whether it works with multi-processing distributed data parallel. I only tested with a single GPU and multi-GPU data parallel. The Tensorflow version still works, but I would not suggest you read it.

This repository contains the codes for the following ICML-2019 paper 

[Approximated Oracle Filter Pruning for Destructive CNN Width Optimization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/ding19a.html).

This demo will show you how to
1. Reproduce 65% pruning ratio of VGG on CIFAR-10.
2. Reproduce 50% pruning ratio of ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10.

About the environment:
1. We used torch==1.3.0, torchvision==0.4.1, CUDA==10.2, NVIDIA driver version==440.82, tensorboard==1.11.0 on a machine with 2080Ti GPUs. 
2. Our method does not rely on any new or deprecated features of any libraries, so there is no need to make an identical environment.
3. If you get any errors regarding tensorboard or tensorflow, you may simply delete the code related to tensorboard or SummaryWriter.


## Introduction

It is not easy to design and run Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to: 1) finding the optimal number of filters (i.e., the width) at each layer is tricky, given an architecture; and 2) the computational intensity of CNNs impedes the deployment on computationally limited devices. Oracle Pruning is designed to remove the unimportant filters from a well-trained CNN, which estimates the filtersâ€™ importance by ablating them in turn and evaluating the model, thus delivers high accuracy but suffers from intolerable time complexity, and requires a given resulting width but cannot automatically find it. To address these problems, we propose Approximated Oracle Filter Pruning (AOFP), which keeps searching for the least important filters in a binary search manner, makes pruning attempts by masking out filters randomly, accumulates the resulting errors, and finetunes the model via a multi-path framework. As AOFP enables simultaneous pruning on multiple layers, we can prune an existing very deep CNN with acceptable time cost, negligible accuracy drop, and no heuristic knowledge, or re-design a model which exerts higher accuracy and faster inference.

## Reproduce 65% pruning ratio of VGG on CIFAR-10.

1. Enter this directory.

2. Make a soft link to your CIFAR-10 directory. If the dataset is not found in the directory, it will be automatically downloaded.
```
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO_CIFAR cifar10_data
```

3. Set the environment variables.
```
export PYTHONPATH=.
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

4. Train the base model.
```
python train_base_model.py -a vc
```

5. Run AOFP. The pruned weights will be saved to "aofp_models/vc_train/finish_pruned.hdf5" and automatically tested.
```
python aofp/do_aofp.py -a vc
```

6. Show the name and shape of weights in the pruned model.
```
python display_hdf5.py aofp_models/vc_train/finish_pruned.hdf5
```

## Reproduce 50% pruning ratio of ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10.

1. Enter this directory.

2. Make a soft link to your CIFAR-10 directory. If the dataset is not found in the directory, it will be automatically downloaded.
```
ln -s YOUR_PATH_TO_CIFAR cifar10_data
```

3. Set the environment variables.
```
export PYTHONPATH=.
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

4. Train the base model.
```
python train_base_model.py -a src56
```

5. Run AOFP. The pruned weights will be saved to "aofp_models/src56_train/finish_pruned.hdf5" and automatically tested.
```
python aofp/do_aofp.py -a src56
```

6. Show the name and shape of weights in the pruned model.
```
python display_hdf5.py aofp_models/src56_train/finish_pruned.hdf5
```
